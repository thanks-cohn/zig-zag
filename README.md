# zig.zg

The full-stack application platform for Zig.

CLI name: `zag`.

zig.zg exists to become a practical application platform for Zig across backend,
frontend, WebAssembly, desktop, mobile, and operating-system runtimes. The first
milestone is deliberately small: establish a CLI that developers can trust.

## Current Status

The first real CLI foundation works now:

- zag builds
- zag version works
- zag help works
- zag doctor performs real checks
- zag new creates a compilable Zig project
- smoke test proves generated app builds and runs

Not implemented yet:

- HTTP runtime
- routing
- frontend rendering
- WebAssembly targets
- desktop or mobile runtimes
- deployment tooling

Those features should grow from this foundation rather than from placeholders.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Zig installed and available on `PATH`
- A writable working directory

Build the CLI:

```sh
zig build
```

Check the local environment:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/zag doctor
```

Create a new Zig app:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/zag new my_app
cd my_app
zig build
zig build run
```

Run the smoke test:

```sh
./tests/smoke.sh
```

## Commands

```sh
zag version
zag help
zag doctor
zag new <name>
```

### `zag version`

Prints:

```text
zag 0.0.1
zig.zg application platform bootstrap
```

### `zag help`

Prints usage text and lists the supported commands.

### `zag doctor`

Runs real checks for the minimum working environment:

- the current directory is writable
- `zig version` can run
- `templates/basic` exists
- `templates/basic/build.zig` exists
- `templates/basic/src/main.zig` exists

Failure messages explain what failed, the likely cause, and the next file or
command to inspect.

### `zag new <name>`

Creates a compilable Zig project using the `templates/basic` template. The
command refuses invalid project names and refuses to overwrite an existing file
or directory.

Generated projects contain:

```text
<name>/
├── build.zig
└── src/
    └── main.zig
```

Generated projects support:

```sh
zig build
zig build run
```

The generated app prints:

```text
hello from zig.zg
```

## Philosophy

This is not a toy and not a theatrical demo. The project should prefer small,
real, compiling foundations over invented APIs. Each milestone should increase
trust: clear commands, understandable failures, real generated code, and no fake
framework surface area.

The first win is not routing, frontend rendering, or WebAssembly. The first win
is that a developer can clone the repository, build `zag`, create a Zig app,
build it, run it, and understand what to inspect if something fails.
